# VisualFlow: AI-Powered Diagram Generator

VisualFlow is a Next.js application that allows you to generate diagrams from text descriptions using a multi-model AI pipeline.

## Features

-   **AI-Powered Diagram Generation:** Describe your diagram in plain English and let the AI build it for you.
-   **Secure API Handling:** API keys are securely managed on the backend using Next.js API routes.
-   **Minimalist UI:** A clean and intuitive interface for generating and viewing diagrams.
-   **Customizable Modes & Themes:** Tailor the diagram's style to your needs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v18 or later)
-   npm

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd visualflow-nextjs
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    -   Create a new file named `.env.local` in the root of the project.
    -   Copy the contents of `.env.example` into your new `.env.local` file.
    -   Replace the placeholder values with your actual API keys from Chutes.ai.

    Your `.env.local` file should look like this:
    ```
    KIMI_API_KEY="your_kimi_api_key_here"
    QWEN_VL_API_KEY="your_qwen_vl_api_key_here"
    QWEN_IMAGE_API_KEY="your_qwen_image_api_key_here"
    ```

### Running the Application

Once your dependencies are installed and your environment variables are configured, you can start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.

## How It Works

The application uses a three-step AI pipeline to generate diagrams:

1.  **Analysis (Kimi K2):** The initial text prompt is sent to the Kimi K2 model to analyze the concept, identify the core elements, and determine if images are needed.
2.  **Image Generation (Qwen Image):** If images are required, the Qwen Image model generates them based on the prompts from the analysis step.
3.  **Verification & Organization (Qwen 3 VL):** The final diagram structure is generated by the Qwen 3 VL model, which takes the analysis and any generated images into account to produce a cohesive and well-organized diagram.
